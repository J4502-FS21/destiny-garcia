<p> I moved to Misawa AFB, Japan in 2012 with my mom, my active duty step-dad, and two sisters Lilo and Haley. I went to school there from the 7th-11th grade. I attended school on the air force base where to played softball, cheerleading, and learned my love for acting/theatre and photography. I traveled to Tokyo with my family, explored the town I lived in, attended various Japanese festivals, and traveled around Japan and South Korea for sports and theatre tournaments and camps. </p>

<p> In 2018, I graduated High School and moved back to Oklahoma to attend Cameron University where I studied journalism and worked for the university collegian as a staff editor and copy writer for the very first time ever. I did not know where to wanted to go to school after graduation, so I started at a small university my mom had attended where I could live with family and one my mom could afford. After my first semester, I knew that I needed more. I wanted to be challenged more than I wa but I did not know how to solve that problem. </p>

<p> In 2019, I atteneded a Mizzou homecoming football game with my grandpa who is a MU alumni and my dad. By complete coincidence I ran into a lady in the Journalism Institute building who was looking for attendees who signed up for a Journalism school tour. She asked me if I was one of them, and when I told her that I was no she told me "well, now your are". So, I toured the Journalism school completely by accident and they blew me away. I was in deep deep love. I applied in my hotel room that night, paid the application fee myself, and the rest is history. I chose to take a leap of faith, to navigate through residency, financial aid, and student loans to pursure the education I had dreamed of.  </p>
