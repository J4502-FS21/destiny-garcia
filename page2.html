  <h1>My Education</h1>
  <p>I am currently a junior at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. I am specializing in Journalism and Strategic Communication with an emphasis in Social Media and Audience Strategy. When I first came to the journalism school, I really wanted to be a writer, but as I began to work in the newsroom setting and practice the flow of creating a piece through a newsroom, I decided that journalistic writing was not what I wanted to do. Instead, I excelled in creative writing. Although, I value and am knowledgeable of writing for journalistic platforms through my three years of studying it, I found that I could combine my interest for social media, photography, and writing with my curiosity to better understand the underground formation of social media. My goal is to be a digital strategist after I graduate. Although, majoring in creative writing would have been exciting, realistically there was not much to do with a creating writing degree that would provide the amount of financial security I would like to have with my career. Through the Journalism School, I have learned by doing via The Missouri Method, and have learned how to write to specific audiences, how to find sources, how to conduct interviews, how to use camera and video equiptment and have taken advantage of other special opportunities. One of which is taking the Novak Leadership Institute "Organizational Culture and Leadership" course where I researched KOMU for an ethnography, built relationships with profound professors and obtained a mentor through their program. I think what makes Mizzou's Journalism School one step ahead of others is the resources and opportunities that are built into the curriculum. As a student whose family could not afford this school, I had to weigh the benefit of attending with the cost of attending. I do not regret my decision to move away to a place where I knew no one, as an out-of-state student, without financial support or a college fund, to attend my dream school because I KNEW that it would pay off. So far, it has. </p>
