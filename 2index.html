  <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
  <p>I am Destiny Garcia, a student, daughter, sister, feminist and dog lover. To get to know me better, I will explain my life through photos below.  </p>
  <p>You can send me an e-mail at <a href="drgpnd@umsystem.edu">drgpnd@umsystem.edu</a></p>
<p> I was born to a single mother in Lawton, Oklahoma where I resided for 12 years. </p>
<p> I moved to Misawa AFB, Japan in 2012 with my mom, step-dad, and two sisters Lilo and Haley. I went to school here from the 7th-11th grade. I attended school on the air force base where to played softball, cheerleading, and learned my love for acting/theatre and photography. I traveled to Tokyo with my family, explored the town I lived in, attended various Japanese festivals, and traveled around Japan and South Korea for sports and theatre tournaments and camps. </p>
<p> In 2017, my family was moved to Scott AFB, Illinois where to finished my senior year and high school and grew to love creative writing.</p>
<p> In 2018, I graduated High School and moved back to Oklahoma to attend Cameron University where I studied journalism and worked for the university collegian as a staff editor and copy writer for the very first time ever. I was only there for one semester </p>
<p> In 2019, I atteneded a Mizzou homecoming football game with my grandpa who is a MU alumni and my dad. By complete coincidence I ran into a lady in the Journalism Institute builing who was looking for attendees who signed up for a Journalism school tour. She asked me if I was one of them, when I told her that I was not one of them, she told me "well, now your are". I toured the school and fell in love. I applied in my hotel room that night, paid the application fee myself, and the rest is history. </p>
<p> I now am a student studying at my dream school, The University of Missouri School of Journalism. I work part time as a waitress to afford school like many other students do and live with my boyfriend and dog-son, Eugene. </p>
